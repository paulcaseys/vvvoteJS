[vvvote](http://vvvote.com/) - flexible and secure voting API for JavaScript
==================================================


vvvote is a secure, managable voting system. 
Suitable for competitions and internet projects that may need moderation 
and/or facebook+twitter tallies.

The items being voted on can grow as time goes by. It is flexible.

You can define the day that the voting begins and also define when voting closes.

You can restrict the votes by 
--------------------------------------

- ip address (automatically recorded), 
- email address (user submitted), or 
- phone number (user submitted)

You can vote up (+1), or vote down (-1), or vote with no value (0, for initialising the item)


In terms of development, the primary unique identifier is 
external_reference_string

This string can be a url, person's name, location, vegetables, anything!
